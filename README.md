# CATAM-9.3-Protein-Comparison-in-Bioinformatics

A rewrite of my Cambridge CATAM undergraduate project, "Protein Comparison in Bioinformatics".

## Go

This project is written in [Go](https://go.dev/learn/), a performant language that combines the readability of languages like python with the speed and safety of languages like C++. Since this project primarily focuses on string manipulation, readability is important for ensuring code functions as expected.

## The project

The aim of this project is to study protein & DNA comparison. Efficient identification and comparison of biomolecular sequences has become a central tool of modern molecular biology, allowing biologists to better understand the function and prevalence of particular sequences.
